Anomaly detection is a classic problem in computer vision. Typically, it should be addressed as a supervised learning problem, but this requires large, labeled datasets. For many unusual real-world problems, cases samples are of insufficient sizes to be effectively modeled.

In a new paper Durham University researchers introduce a anomaly detection model, GANomaly, comprising a conditional generative adversarial network that “jointly learns the generation of high-dimensional image space and the inference of latent space.” The process enables the model to perform anomaly detection tasks even in sample-poor environments.
